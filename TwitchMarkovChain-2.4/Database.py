class Database:

    """
    The database created is called `MarkovChain_{channel}.db`, 
    and populated with 27 + 27^2 = 756 tables. Firstly, 27 tables with the structure of
    "MarkovStart{char}", i.e. called:
    > MarkovStartA
    > MarkovStartB
    > ...
    > MarkovStartZ
    > MarkovStart_
    These tables store the first two words of a sentence, alongside a "count" frequency. 
    The suffix of the table name is the first character of the first word in the entry.

    For example, from a sentence "I am the developer of this bot", "I am" is learned by creating
    or updating an entry in MarkovStartI where the first word is "I", the second word is "am",
    and the "count" value increments every time the sequence "I am" was learned.

    If instead we learn, "[he said hello]", then "[he said" is learned by creating or updating
    an entry in MarkovStart_.



    Alongside the MarkovStart... tables, there are 729 tables called "MarkovGrammar{char}{char}",
    i.e. called:
    > MarkovGrammarAA
    > MarkovGrammarAB
    > ...
    > MarkovGrammarAZ
    > MarkovGrammarA_
    > MarkovGrammarBA
    > MarkovGrammarBB
    > ...
    > MarkovGrammar_Z
    > MarkovGrammar__
    These tables store 3-grams, alongside a "count" frequency of this 3-gram. The suffix of the 
    table name is the first character of the first word in the 3-gram, with the first character
    of the second word in the 3-gram.

    If we revisit the example of "I am the developer of this bot", we learn the following 3-grams:
    > "I am the"
    > "am the developer"
    > "the developer of"
    > "developer of this"
    > "of this bot"
    > "this bot <END>"
    The 3-gram "am the developer" will be placed in MarkovGrammarAT, by creating or updating an entry
    where the first word is "am", the second is "the", and the third "developer", while the "count"
    frequency is incremented every time the 3-gram "am the developer" is learned.



    The core of the knowledge base are the MarkovGrammar tables, which can be used to create 
    functions that take a certain number of words as input, and then generate a new word. For example:
    Given "I am", we can use the MarkovGrammarIA table to look for entries that have "I" as the first word,
    and "am" as the second word. If there are multiple options, we can use the "count" frequency as
    weights to pick an appropriate "next word".



    Important notes:
    - Learning is *case sensitive*. The 3-gram "YOU ARE A" will become a different entry than "you are a". 
      This is most important when learning emotes, where the distinction between "Kappa" and "kappa" truly is important.
    - Generating is *case insensitive*. Generating when using "YOU ARE" as the previous words to use in e.g. self.get_next()
      will get the same results as generating using "you are".

    - Learning and generating is *punctuation insensitive*. Each sentence is tokenized to split commas, dots, apostrophes, etc.
      As a result, the sentence "Hello, I'm Tom!" is tokenized to: ["Hello", ",", "I", "'m", "Tom", "!"]. Then, 3-grams of this
      is learned. 

    - Both learning and generating is *punctuation sensitive*. "Hello, how are" will learn and generate differently than
      "Hello how are", as the first word is taken as "Hello,", which differs from "Hello". 
      A solution is to completely remove punctuation. Before learning, before generating, etc. 
      Essentially ignore that it exists.
      However, this is not entirely desirable. In a perfect world, we would like to learn "hello," 
      and "hello" differently, just like "HELLO" and "hello", but allow generating from "hello"
      to both get results from "hello" and "hello,".
